Splunk workloads deployed to augment datagen.  The following workloads were created:
    - frontendclicker deployment: Simulates frontend activity for opentelemetry-demo
    - stress-ng-deployment:       Simulates CPU-heavy workloads with some randomness
    - nginx-oom-deployment:       Regularly violates memory limits set so pods will be killed
    - cleanup-failed-pods:        A cronjob to delete failed pods more than 30 minutes old


Your class environment has been deployed to Kubernetes. Run the following command to
ensure that everything loaded.
    kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=splunk-datagens

There should be no pending or failed pods.
